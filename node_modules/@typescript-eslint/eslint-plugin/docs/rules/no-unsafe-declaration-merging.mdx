TypeScript's "declaration merging" supports merging separate declarations with the same name.

Declaration merging between classes and interfaces is unsafe.
<<<<<<< HEAD
The TypeScript compiler doesn't check whether properties are initialized, which can lead to TypeScript not detecting code that will cause runtime errors.

```ts
interface Foo {
  nums: number[];
}

class Foo {}

const foo = new Foo();

foo.nums.push(1); // Runtime Error: Cannot read properties of undefined.
```

## Examples

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="❌ Incorrect">

```ts
interface Foo {}

class Foo {}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="✅ Correct">

```ts
interface Foo {}
class Bar implements Foo {}

namespace Baz {}
namespace Baz {}
enum Baz {}

namespace Qux {}
function Qux() {}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## When Not To Use It

If your project intentionally defines classes and interfaces with unsafe declaration merging patterns, this rule might not be for you.
You might consider using [ESLint disable comments](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/configure/rules#using-configuration-comments-1) for those specific situations instead of completely disabling this rule.
