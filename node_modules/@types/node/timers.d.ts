/**
 * The `timer` module exposes a global API for scheduling functions to

 * globals, there is no need to import `node:timers` to use the API.
 *
 * The timer functions within Node.js implement a similar API as the timers API
 * provided by Web Browsers but use a different internal implementation that is
 * built around the Node.js [Event Loop](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/guides/event-loop-timers-and-nexttick/#setimmediate-vs-settimeout).
